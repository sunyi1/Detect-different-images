For this task, first I tried to set each image which is in the training set as array. So I want to compare my test image with the training sets by each element in array. But when I used this method, I got a really bad accuracy. Therefore, I changed my method and used opencv package to solve this task.

For the accuracy part,
in my opinion, if I can get a very high accuracy. At the beginning, I tried 
to test my image in the training set. I can get one hundred per cent accuracy if I set my threshold is 0.9. But if I test my image is not come from the trainning set. My threshold still is 0.9. I cannot recongnite my test image in which class. But my threshold is too high. So I changed my threshold to 0.7. I also set a counter to record how many result is bigger than 0.7. Therefore, I can compare each class. And I can get the largest number from which class has more similar image.

I also did my own nertual network to test this task. But my accuracy is very low. I think I only have ten per cent accuracy in my own nertual network by compare each image as an array. But the accuracy is very low. I do not know why.
